# SCPRP-Addons-Archive

The following repository is an archive of all the addons I've developed for MetaMethod's SCP:RP.

The programming language in question is Lua. Please bare in mind that the game has its own custom functions, which can be found by [reading their documentation here](https://scproleplay.com/docs/server-addons/).

A few other things that should be considered:
- All addons are up-to-date as of posting. Reminder that this is an archive; I won't be actively updating them unless I want to. Expect older addons to no longer work.
- Do not ask me to help set up these addons for you. The answer will almost always be "no".
- Addons using the http function may require a proxy website depending on where you're trying to send data to. Please bare this in mind should you wish to use any of these addons.
- Don't ask me to explain how any of the code works. I've added comments to try and explain, but if you still don't understand it, code the addon yourself, or just get someone else/AI to do it for you.
- I've intentionally left out a few of my addons. Some because I'm still developing them, some because I want to rework them (terrible, sloppy code), and some because I felt like it. Don't ask for them to be put up.

Ok.
Bye.
